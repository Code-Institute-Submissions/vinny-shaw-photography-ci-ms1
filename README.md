Welcome to my Code Institute MS1 Project.

The website is designed to be the online hub for the business **Vinny Shaw Photography**, to showcase their work, promote the services they offer and provide information for new and existing clients to easily contact them.

## UX

The aim of this website is to present the skills, services, work examples and contact information of the owner, in a clear and stylish manner.

Simple, minimal font styles and text placement allow the user to easily navigate the content and information, while experiencing a full-page presentation of the owners work throughout.
