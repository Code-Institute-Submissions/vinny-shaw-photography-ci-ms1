## Bugs and fixes

1. Known bug with iOS devices.

- ```.bg-img {
    background-position: center center;
    background-attachment: scroll;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
  }
  ```

- `background-attachment: scroll;`
  - must be used on smaller screens for iOS devices.
- `background-attachment: fixed;`

  - is later placed in a CSS media query for larger screens to allow the desired parallax effect.
